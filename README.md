# PickupGameFinder
A web app for finding pick-up basketball games. This app is still a work in progress.

The app is up and running [here](https://ollij5.github.io/PickupGameFinder/).

The backend code of this application can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/OlliJ5/PickupGameFinder-back).

## Running the app locally
Clone this repository to your machine.

Navigate to the root of the app. This is the directory where the file package.json is.

Run the command:
```
npm install
```
This will install the dependencies needed for the project.

Run the command:
```
npm start
```
This starts the frontend.

You also need to start the backend locally for the app to work.
Check out the [backend repository](https://github.com/OlliJ5/PickupGameFinder-back) for information on how to do that.
